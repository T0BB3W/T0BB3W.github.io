# h2 Kill Chain
### Read and Summarize
#### [Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, Hutchins et al 2011](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)
- Compromise of data for economic or military advancement, is called APT, short for Advanced Persistant Threat.
- APT actors demonstrate the capability to compromise systems by using advanced tools, customized malware, and “zero-day” exploits that anti-virus and patching cannot detect or mitigate, contrary to traditional automated viruses and worms.
- An intelligence-driven, threat-focused approach to study intrusions from the adversaries’ perspective is introduced as means for defenders, to achieve an advantage over the aggressor for APT caliber adversaries.
- Defenders must be able to move their detection and analysis up the kill chain and more importantly to implement courses of actions across the kill chain.
- Core objective of campaign analysis is to understand the intruders’ intent. To the extent that defenders can determine technologies or individuals of interest.
- Intelligence-driven computer network defense is a necessity in light of advanced persistent threats.
