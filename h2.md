# h2 Kill Chain
### Read and Summarize
#### [Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, Hutchins et al 2011](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)
- Compromise of data for economic or military advancement, is called APT, short for Advanced Persistant Threat.
- APT actors demonstrate the capability to compromise systems by using advanced tools, customized malware, and “zero-day” exploits that anti-virus and patching cannot detect or mitigate, contrary to traditional automated viruses and worms.
- This paper presents a new intrusion kill chain model to analyze intrusions and drive defensive courses of action.
- The intrusion kill chain is defined as reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives.
- An intelligence-driven, threat-focused approach to study intrusions from the adversaries’ perspective is introduced as means for defenders, to achieve an advantage over the aggressor for APT caliber adversaries.
- Defenders must be able to move their detection and analysis up the kill chain and more importantly to implement courses of actions across the kill chain.
- Core objective of campaign analysis is to understand the intruders’ intent. To the extent that defenders can determine technologies or individuals of interest.
- Intelligence-driven computer network defense is a necessity in light of advanced persistent threats.
- Insightfully this was a pleasant and bountiful read, and even though it's from 2011 the content is still highly relevant, I also learned that threat chaining is commonly used to model IED attacks aswell, which makes total sense given their similar properties.
### Tactics, tools & procedures
#### Answer in the context of MITRE ATT&CK:

Define **tactic** and give an example of a specific tactic:

**Tactic**'s represent "why" or the reason(s) an adversary is performing an action.
- For example #1 in the kill chain, reconnaissance, adversaries try gathering information in preparation for operations.

Define **technique** and **subtechnique**, and give an example of each:

**Techniques**: How adversaries achieve tactical goals by performing actions.
- Access token manipulation, modification of access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.
- **Subtechniques** are more descriptive or specific techniques used, as techniques are more general. For example a subtechnique to access token manipulation would be token impersonation/theft.

Define **procedure**, and give an example of each:

**Procedures** are specific implementation or in-the-wild use the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques.
- Access token manipulation, A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.
- Token impersonation/theft, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using DuplicateToken or DuplicateTokenEx. The token can then be used with ImpersonateLoggedOnUser to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context.
