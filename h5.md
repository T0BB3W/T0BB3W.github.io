## Read & Summarize
### [Schneider 2015, Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/08_chap01.html#chap01-sec001)
- Cryptographys core purpose is security: a **sender** wants to securely send a message to a **receiver**, ensuring that no unauthorized parties (eavesdroppers) can't read it
- The chapter describes basic concepts of cryptography such as the order of encryption with some vocabulary; plaintext -> encryption -> cipheretext -> decryption -> original plaintext
- Modern cryptography, and most it operations alike, increasingly rely on advanced mathematics today

### [Karvinen 2023, PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/)
- Article/tutorial about public keys and using PGP encryption with a gpg tool

## Install OpenSSH server, connect to it using ssh client
`sudo apt update` update packages

`sudo apt install openssh-server` install openssh-server

`sudo systemctl status ssh` check status of ssh; active running

`ssh debianuser@127.0.0.1` connecting to the ssh from the vm, from another terminal, asks for password.

## Automate SSH connection using public keys
`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` genkey

`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` copy the public key to the `authorized_keys` file, set permissions of the file using `chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

using `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` look for the following lines in the config and uncomment them or add them `PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys` use ctrl+o to save, and ctrl+x to exit

reboot the ssh using `sudo systemctl restart ssh` and connect again using `ssh` command, works without having to enter password now!
