# h1 Should Tero wear a helmet?
### Summarize the following:
#### [Threat modeling manifesto, Braiterman et al 2020](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)
- Threat modeling is very important to recognize what vulnerabilities a system might have, and anyone who is concerned about the privacy, safety and security of their system.
- The threat modeling manifesto should be used as a guideline to develop or refine a methodology that best fits ones needs.
- The manifesto follows a similar format to that of the agile manifesto by identifying values and principles.

Values: finding and fixing design issues, collaboration, understanding, threat modeling, refinement.

Principles: improve security and privacy through analysis, alignment with org's development practices, meaningfulness correlates with value to stakeholders, dialog to establish common understandings.

#### [Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course, Shostack 2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVhBqLDKoOOZqKt74QI4pbDUnXSQo0nf)
- Threat modeling is done to anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them.
- Threat modeling is a set of methods that allow us to think about security before any coding or concrete actions have begun, so that everything is as secure as we need it to be.
- Threat modeling can be simplified to four core questions; What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good job?
- Sketching is important for threat modeling, it allows us to start putting our thoughts into actionable things.
- Record everything that is done, so that the documentation can be used when it is needed.
- Data flow diagrams are heavily associated with threat modeling since threats tend to follow data, they are simple to draw and use.
- Structure is needed to get a consistent result, since many people can work on the same threat model at different times.
- Threat modeling precedes risk management, and informs risk management

#### [Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet, OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- Threat modeling is ideally done in the early stages of the Software Lifecycle Development Cycle, such as during the design phase.
- Use STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) as a framework to identify threats.
- After identification, formulate and document actionable mitigation strategies, tailor them to the system's needs, for example: OWASP, ASVS or MITRE CWE.
- Review and validate the threat model periodically or when significant changes occur, for relevance and effectivity.
- Utilize tools that simplify and automate threat modeling, such as: OWASP's Threat Dragon or Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool. These tools make the process more accessible and less time-consuming.

#### Infosec scene: [Darknet Diaries Ep 22: Mini-Stories: Vol 1 on spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6MeXRqElCoAe3vMDvoXcvT?si=SUGlvdwXTVSWQdcVmCxDWw)
I prompted Grok 2 ai to find out which episode would be most suitable and bite sized, for a novice to the subject such as myself, and was very pleased with the episode. The episode is 43 mins long and contains 3 short stories, stories too good for the podcast host to pass up on but not long enough for their own episode.
- The first story is about a penetration testing company that accidentally penetration tested the wrong company. The company that hired the penetration company for testing, let's call them Widgetmaker Co, since the nature of the company was to create an app for making widgets. Widgetmaker Co accidentally gave the wrong ip addresses inside (1) ip range, which so happened to be the ip adresses to another company, specified in extremely similar practices, let's call them Widgetmaker LLC. Widgetmaker Co wanted the penetration testing company to find the developmental versions of said app in their systems, but after vigorous penetration testing, they could not find it, but on the flip side, they got access to Widgetmaker LLC's email servers, were able to execute scripts remotely and take control of computers in said company. They basically illegally penetrated this LLC. After this came to light the penetration testing co and Widgetmaker Co swiftly started seeking legal advice, and working overtime. The time came to contact the LLC's head of security, they could not find his information anywhere but fortunately they had access to the email servers and got the information that way. The head of security was actually happy and asked for the report, but the lawyers and managers of all involved companies in this fiasco were not. The penetration testing company did not have to do penetration testing on the Co, and they were just happy that no legal action was taken.

This story I found almost hilarious, and what are the odds of something like this happening, that the very similarly named companies ip adress ranges were just one(1) ip point from each other, and that at no point, did the penetration testers connect the dots.
- The second story is about a person who works at a private company that does threat modeling and implementation for critical infrastructure in the US, for example nuclear power plants, water turbines, wind farms, etc. He was contacted by a small water turbine company, that sells their electricity to a larger company for distribution. The company was in dire need of help, as they claimed their systems were already breached, to which the threat modeler was surprised, since this is not ususally the order things go in. He was interested as to why they think their systems have been breached. The water turbine co explained that every individual turbine is controlled by a windows computer of their own, and that their patching cycle had changed from what they had implemented. After investigation the truth came up, very experienced breachers had installed bitcoin miners on the computers, but also provided a better patching cycle for the machines, without affecting the monitoring capabilities of them negatively. They decided to add additional monitoring and security practices to the computers, but still allow the breachers to mine bitcoin using their computers, since they had made the patching cycle better. The threat modeling guy was very confused to this day in the wind turbine co's decision.

This story was a good example of why fix something that is not broken. I think this is still not the way to go since bitcoin mining will strain the hardware of the water turbine computers, and they were already running around the clock to collect diagnostics and monitor the turbines.
- The third and last story was about someone called Snow, who got a passion for hacking after accidentally going to DEF CON and falling in love with it immediately. Only three years later she won the entire DEF CON and was awarded the black badge. The host and Snow go on discussing her personal achievements for a long time, which I found a little tedious, and the story itself was only 5-10mins long. After winning the competition she was getting job offers left and right, but she wanted to go into social engineering. The story tells of her breaching the premises of a company. One day she pulls up at the front desk of the company looking lost and confused and leaning over the reception desk, to try and find any vulnerabilities. She laid eyes on some event being arranged in the next couple of days and went on with her day. Next time she arrives she is dressed in business attire, has her hair done etc. She had also made a fake id badge for this particular event, pretending to be a representative of another company, which the event was for. The receptionist did not even think twice and she was given a guest badge and given a tour of the entire premises, all five floors.

I really enjoyed the story at the end, even though the beginning was tedious, social engineering is something I would be interested in doing myself one day. Human elements are in my opinion much bigger security vulnerabilities than digital ones. Reflectively, I remember working at GE Healthcare and having a lot of security trainings around one time since the security of the company was compromised, and some people outside of the organization had even been given unauthorized key flaps for the premises, "to make their job easier".
