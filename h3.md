## Read & Summarize
### [Install Debian on VirtualBox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/), Karvinen 2021
I don't have much to add to this, well made tutorial with good comments, we also went through this in class, so was easy to do the installation, I had no problems what so ever, also most of the "expert settings" etc. were easily understandable for me since I have installed plenty of os on computers and vms, just not linux ones.

### [Command Line Basics Revisited](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/), Karvinen 2020
Command line basics, I have some experience in using these but definitely need to use them more to actually get them to stick. Good to use as a guideline when working with linux cli. Did use many of these when doing the following assignments and the overthewire bandit wargames.

### Can't fish. Disable networking and show that packets don't go through:
I just disabled networking from the Visual Interface in the top right corner, and then used `ping 1.1.1.1`

### Local only. Portscan your own computer using "localhost" address. Disconnect computer from the Internet while testing.
First I need to install the tool for port scanning.

`sudo apt update` // updates package lists, to ensure the package information is current

`sudo apt install nmap` // one of the most common tools for port scanning is "nmap", this command installs it

`nmap localhost` // portscans localhost but doesnt give much info without using -sV (service Version detection),

### Daemon scan. Install a daemon (a server application) and port scan again.
`sudo apt update` // update package list

`sudo apt install apache2` // install apache2, it will run automatically after installation

`systemctl status apache2` // status of apache2, was running just fine, have to press ctrl+c to get back to cli

`sudo nmap -sV localhost` // using the -sV , it attempts to determine what service is running on the ports, this allowed me to see that apache was running and using port 80

### Some further testing on my own

`sudo systemctl stop apache2` // stop, start, restart can all be used here in place of "stop"

`nmap localhost` // shows that port 80 is no longer in use, apache not on

`reset` //reset console, doesnt reset processes, but resets terminal settings for example if terminal's behavior becomes erratic

`nmap localhost` // no apache running on port 80

`sudo systemctl start apache2` // start the apache

`systemctl status apache2` // shows it as running have to press ctrl+c to get out of the view back to the cli

`nmap -sV localhost` // can see the apache running on port 80


`reset` //reset console

`nmap -sV localhost` // shows apache still running, even though I used reset!

`systemctl stop apache2` // trying to close the apache, **os asks for password since not using sudo**. after entering password shuts it down

`nmap -sV localhost` // shows no apache

### Bandit oh-five. Solve Over The Wire: Bandit first five levels.
- Level 0, log in using ssh, password for first level can be found on the website. `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
- Level 1, find the first password when logged into level 0, can be found in a file called readme `cat readme`
- Level 2, log into level 1 using `ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` and the password found in previous level, password for the next level can be found in a file called "-", `cat ./-`
- Level 3, logging in using the same command as earlier, password from last level. To find the password which is in a file called "spaces in this filename" use, `cat "spaces in this filename"`
- Level 4, to find pw for level 4 which is hidden in a hidden file in the inhere directory, `find ./inhere` returns ./inhere & ./inhere/...Hiding-From-You, then `cat ./inhere/...Hiding-From-You` which returns the password
- Level 5, pw for level 5 is in the only human readable file in the inhere directory, i used `ls ./inhere` to see the files in the directory, there were only 10 files so i went through them manually using `cat ./inhere/-file00` etc. the password was in one of the files
