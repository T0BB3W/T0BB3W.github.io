## Read & Summarize
### [Install Debian on VirtualBox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/), Karvinen 2021
I don't have much to add to this, well made tutorial with good comments, we also went through this in class, so was easy to do the installation, I had no problems what so ever, also most of the "expert settings" etc. were easily understandable for me since I have installed plenty of os on computers and vms, just not linux ones.

### [Command Line Basics Revisited](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/), Karvinen 2020
Command line basics, I have some experience in using these but definitely need to use them more to actually get them to stick. Good to use as a guideline when working with linux cli. Did use many of these when doing the following assignments and the overthewire bandit wargames.

### Can't fish. Disable networking and show that packets don't go through:
I just disabled networking from the Visual Interface in the top right corner, and then used `ping 1.1.1.1`

`sudo apt update` // updates package lists, to ensure the package information is current
`sudo apt install nmap` // one of the most common tools for port scanning is "nmap", this command installs it

`nmap localhost` // portscans localhost but doesnt give much info without using -sV (service Version detection),

`sudo apt update` // update package list
`sudo apt install apache2` // install apache2, it will run automatically after installation
`systemctl status apache2` // status of apache2, was running just fine, have to press ctrl+c to get back to cli

`sudo nmap -sV localhost` // using the -sV , it attempts to determine what service is running on the ports, this allowed me to see that apache was running and using port 80
`sudo systemctl stop apache2` // stop, start, restart can all be used here in place of "stop"
`nmap localhost` // shows that port 80 is no longer in use, apache not on

`reset` //reset console

`nmap localhost` // no apache running on port 80
`sudo systemctl start apache2` // start the apache
`systemctl status apache2` // shows it as running have to press ctrl+c to get out of the view back to the cli
`nmap -sV localhost` // can see the apache running on port 80

`reset` //reset console, doesnt reset processes, but resets terminal settings for example if terminal's behavior becomes erratic
`nmap -sV localhost` // shows apache still running, even though we used reset!
`systemctl stop apache2` // trying to close the apache, os asks for password since not using sudo prefix. after entering password shuts it down
`nmap -sV localhost` // shows no apache
