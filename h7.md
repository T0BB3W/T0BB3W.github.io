- The anonymity provided by Tor cannot be entirely circumvented, even by governmental interests.
- Not made for criminals/crime. Use cases include access to data in censored countries etc.
- Open source and has been vetted for backdoors.
- Easy to use, but using it incorrectly can destroy your anonymity.

### [Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hiding-behind-the/9780128033524/XHTML/B9780128033401000021/B9780128033401000021.xhtml)

Tor directs the route of the users internet traffic through random relays. Every relay strips away one layer of encryption, the onion analogy is strong here. Tor traffic is very difficult, if not impossible to track. Tor chooses a different entry, middle, and exit relay every 10 minutes or so. 

FBI has cracked connections before, although by the use of exploits in firefox etc. since the tor browser is based on firefox. Authorities have also caught wrong guys several times, once they busted through the door of someone they thought was hosting child pornography but he was just hosting an exit relay.

The user generally seems to be the weakest link when discussing Tor's security. It is recommended to not try and configure any settings of Tor, since most likely you won't know what you're doing, and will just reveal your identity.
