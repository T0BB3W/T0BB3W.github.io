### OWASP: OWASP 10 2021
[A01:2021 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
- Number one security risk in 2021 according to OWASP
- Systems are failing to properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users can do
- Unauthorized access to data for threat actors
- Bypassing access control checks
- Manipulating parameters to escalate privileges
- Prevention; better session management, server-side checks instead of reliance on client-side controls

[A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)
- Misconfiguration, for example: Default config's left unchanged, unnecessary features, verbose or too descriptive error messages giving crucial information to threat actors, outdated software
- These misconfigurations can allow unauthorized access to system data, or enable attacks such as SQL Injection
- Mitigation: Secure app architecture, regular updating and patching of systems, removing or disabling unnecessary features, proper security settings applied across **ALL** environments

[A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
- Software components eg. libraries, frameworks or other software modules that aren't up to date or have known security flaws
- These components are usually embedded within the app or part of the underlying os or platform
- "Components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact."
- These lead to data breaches or system compromise
- Mitigation: Inventory of all components, their versions, dependencies, and ensuring effective update and patching schedule to stay up to date

Here is an article that I recently read that came to mind when reading on Vulnerable and Outdated Components: [How to make any AMD Zen CPU always generate 4 as a random number](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/04/google_amd_microcode/)

[A03:2021 - Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)
- Untrusted data sent to interpreter as part of a command or query, this can lead to attackers executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization
- Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in user input validation, filtration, or sanitization, allowing them to inject malicious code
- Mitigation: Parameterized queries, input validation, employing libraries or frameworks that automatically get rid of special characters, and last but **definitely NOT least**, least privilege principles!

[Munroe: xkcd 327: Exploits of a Mom](https://xkcd.com/327/)

Silly cartoon regarding SQL Injections, made me realize the true implications of sanitization, that for example anybody can just use these on a text field on some survey etc. on the web, and be very successful since SQL is still one of the most widely used query languages to this day.
