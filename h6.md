## Read & summarize
### [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)
- Fundamental building blocks for most of the protocols discussed in the book.
- Easy to compute but extremely difficult to reverse, if not practically impossible (physical compute limitations).
- A message encrypted with the one-way function isn't useful; no one could decrypt it, however one way functions can be used for authentication, the host does not need to know the passwords, it only need to be able to differentiate valid passwords from invalid passwords.
- "Trapdoor one way function" is easy to compute one way, and can also be computed the other way/reversed to the original message/content, if the decrypter has a secret key at their disposal to solve the function.

### [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec004)
- Dear child has many names! Also known as: compression function, contraction function, message digest, fingerprint, cryptographic checksum, message integrity check (MIC), and manipulation detection code (MDC).
- Takes a variable-length input string (pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length (generally smaller) output string (called a hash value). 
- Fingerprinting a pre-image means trying to produce a value that indicates if a candidate pre-image is likely to be the same as the real pre-image.
- A good one-way hash function is collision-free: It is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value.
- Message authentication codes (MAC) is a one way hash function with an additional secret key. The hash value is a function of both the pre-image and the key, allowing only someone with access to the key to verify the hash value.

## Install Hashcat. Test it with a sample hash. See Karvinen 2022: [Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)
Following the instructions here mainly:

Install the apps

`sudo apt-get update` assure everything is up to date

`sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget` install hashcat

Make new directory

`mkdir hashed` make directory

`cd hashed` change to the just made directory

Get a big dictionary, Rockyou is probably the most popular

`wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz` download the compressed file

`tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz` extract the file

`rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz` remove the original compressed file since we already extracted it

Identify hash type

`hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96` using the example hash, -m stands for mode, which is most likely?

Crack the hash

`hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved` -o solved means to save the solution as plain text to a file called solved

the solution is 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96:summer as demonstrated.

## Crack this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

firstly I used `hashid -m d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df` to see which hash types it could potentially be.

then I used `hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved` to save the solution to the text file. I just went for MD5 since it's most common, and turns out it was MD5.

using `cat solved` to see the earlier "6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96:summer" aswell as "d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df:disobey", interestingly, the hashcat showed me pre-image candidates, including "disorder83", and "disney land"
