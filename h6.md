## Read & summarize
### [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)
- Fundamental building blocks for most of the protocols discussed in the book.
- Easy to compute but extremely difficult to reverse, if not practically impossible (physical compute limitations).
- A message encrypted with the one-way function isn't useful; no one could decrypt it, however one way functions can be used for authentication, the host does not need to know the passwords, it only need to be able to differentiate valid passwords from invalid passwords.
- "Trapdoor one way function" is easy to compute one way, and can also be computed the other way/reversed to the original message/content, if the decrypter has a secret key at their disposal to solve the function.

### [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec004)
- Dear child has many names! Also known as: compression function, contraction function, message digest, fingerprint, cryptographic checksum, message integrity check (MIC), and manipulation detection code (MDC).
- Takes a variable-length input string (pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length (generally smaller) output string (called a hash value). 
- Fingerprinting a pre-image means trying to produce a value that indicates if a candidate pre-image is likely to be the same as the real pre-image.
- A good one-way hash function is collision-free: It is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value.
- Message authentication codes (MAC) is a one way hash function with an additional secret key. The hash value is a function of both the pre-image and the key, allowing only someone with access to the key to verify the hash value.
