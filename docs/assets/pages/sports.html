            I play rugby for the Old Town Shamrocks based out of Porvoo. I used to live in porvoo and have such a bond with the team that I ain't leaving. We play on the highest level in Finland in the Men's Championship! I have been playing rugby at the highest level for about 3 seasons, with time off inbetween due to injuries. I snapped my ac-joint in my left shoulder in a game versus Helsinki Warriors in the autumn of 2020 when I was still performing my military service. Safe to say the rest of my military service was eased but the pain was persistent and troublesome to deal with. This summer I twisted my knee in a game, torn ligaments and all sorts of fun stuff. Hoping to play next season and bring home the shiniest trophy of them all!
