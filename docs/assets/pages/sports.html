    <h2>Rugby</h2>
</header>
<p>
    I play rugby for the Old Town Shamrocks based out of Porvoo. I used to live in
    porvoo and have such a bond with the team that I ain't leaving. We play on the
    highest level in Finland in the Men's Championship! I have been playing rugby at
    the highest level for about 3 seasons, with time off inbetween due to injuries.
    I snapped my ac-joint in my left shoulder in a game versus Helsinki Warriors in
    the autumn of 2020 when I was still performing my military service. Safe to say
    the rest of my military service was eased but the pain was persistent and
    troublesome to deal with. This summer I twisted my knee in a game, torn
    ligaments and all sorts of fun stuff. Hoping to play next season and bring home
    the shiniest trophy of them all!

    <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>
</header>
<p>
    I really love working out and lifting weights. I started when I was 16 years old
    and my buddies bullied me for being a fattie. I couldn't be more thankful for
    that. It really made me turn my life around and made me gain so much confidence.
    I used to be really into bodybuilding aswell, and was planning to compete, but
    my passion for rugby is so much greater. I might still compete in bodybuilding
    some day, never say never. I've had many coaches and have done a ton of research
    into diet, training and everything that comes with. I love reading peer-reviewed
    papers on some new bio-hacking tech for the best gains! I also provide coaching
    services and have had several satisfied clients over the years.
